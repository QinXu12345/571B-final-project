## Model Assumption

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{ijk} = \mu + \tau_i+\beta_j+ \left(\tau\beta\right)_{ij} +\gamma_k + \epsilon_{ijk}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mu$ is the overall mean, $\tau_i$ is the mean of activity (walking and meditation)

```{r}
wm <- read.csv("final_data.csv")
wm$User <- as.factor(wm$User)
wm$Time <- as.factor(wm$Time)
wm$Activity <- as.factor(wm$Activity)
```

### Random effect of not studying the interaction of blocking factor

```{r}
library(lmerTest)
wm_lmer <- lmer(Score ~ Time * Activity + (1|User),
                data = wm,
                contrasts = list(Time = "contr.helmert",
                Activity = "contr.helmert"))
```

```{r}
summary(wm_lmer)
```

```{r}
ranova(wm_lmer)
```

```{r}
plot(wm_lmer,which=4)
```

### Fixed effect of not studying the interaction of blocking factor

```{r}
wm_aov <- aov(Score ~ Time * Activity + User,
                data = wm,
                contrasts = list(Time = "contr.helmert",
                Activity = "contr.helmert"))
```

```{r}
summary(wm_aov)
```

```{r}
plot(wm_aov2,which=2)
```

### Fixed effect of study the interaction of blocking factor

```{r}
wm_aov2 <- aov(Score ~ Time * Activity * User,
                data = wm,
                contrasts = list(Time = "contr.helmert",
                Activity = "contr.helmert"))
```

```{r}
anova(wm_aov2)
```

```{r}
interaction.plot(wm$Time,wm$Activity,
                 response = wm$Score,
                 trace.label = "Activity",
                 xlab = "Time",
                 ylab = "Score",
                 col = c("green","red"))
```

### Random effect of studying the interaction of blocking factor

```{r}
wm_lmer2 <- lmer(Score ~ Time * Activity
                 + (Time + Activity|User),
                data = wm,
                contrasts = list(Time = "contr.helmert",
                Activity = "contr.helmert"))
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
ranova(wm_lmer2)
```
