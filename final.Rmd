## Model Assumption

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{ijk} = \mu + \tau_i+\beta_j+ \left(\tau\beta\right)_{ij} +\gamma_k + \epsilon_{ijk}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\mu$ is the overall mean, $\tau_i$ is the mean of activity (walking and meditation)

wm$Time <- as.factor(wm$Time)
wm$Activity <- as.factor(wm$Activity)
